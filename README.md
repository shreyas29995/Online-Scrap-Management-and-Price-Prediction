SCRAPP- A MarketPlace for Scrap and Tangible Waste is an Android application that typically runs the server, and allows the customers to do things such as searching for scrap/waste materials in the catalog, adding a selected product to a basket and placing an order for it. Once a particular product has been found then the seller interacts with the buyer by this application. It also has a feature which predicts the future market price of a particular scrap product using the past dummy values. To achieve this a predictive analysis technique 'Logistic Regression' is used
